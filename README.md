## .Net CyberdropDownloader

This is my Cyberdrop album downloader, written in .Net  
### NOTES
- more threads = more instances of the downloader will be run, which means pottentially faster downloads at higher cpu use
### Changelog
- Users can now change number of threads used <- added in v1.1
- ~~Downloader now uses faster download link <- added in v.1~~ Currently Broken
- Updated Regex <- added in v1.2
- Changed download link scraping to use json instead of regex = increased reliability <- added in v1.3

### How to use

- Just add your album links in a file called links.txt located in same folder as the executable
- Run executable
- Profit???
